title: Mathematical Contest in Modeling
---

National College Students Mathematical Contest in Modeling is a competition that requires students to solve practical problems through modeling and programming, which can exercise and test students' ability of analysis, modeling, programming and writing papers. 

I Led a team in the competition for 4 times:
Acquired a fresh insight of mathematics to support the scientific and technological research;
Accumulated experiences in literature reviews and academic writings.

## Impact of asteroid mining on global equity

Modeled and studied the factors that affect fairness in the world and accomplished the paper writing.

1. Data collection and preprocessing. 
2. Use secondary fuzzy comprehensive evaluation to build a model of global equity based on 
the happiness indicators of countries, which includes objective and subjective factors. 
3. Establish a model to analyze the impacts of asteroid mining, and get the degree of global 
equity after asteroid mining. 
4. Change the models and parameters of the impact of asteroid mining, compare the degree of 
the global equity. 
5. Come up with policies of asteroid mining for more global equity.

## Analysis and optimization of process conditions for catalytic coupling of ethanol to prepare C4 olefins

I used Python and SPSS to explore ethanol catalysis based on multivariate ANOVA, Spearman correlation coefficient analysis.

1. The use of mature statistical software SPSS is relatively simple to operate and has a high degree of feasibility.
2. Comprehensively consider the relationship between the influencing factors, use multi-factor analysis of variance, not just a single T test for a certain indicator. Or one-way analysis of variance, there will be no chance of errors in the analysis of influencing factors, and it will not be difficult to obtain inconsistencies in the analysis results.to a comprehensive conclusion.
3. The research results range from special to general, from the perspectives of optimization and prediction, and establish models to discuss the optimal choice of catalysts.
4. The model designs experiments according to the results, has the realistic ability to explore the actual results, and can further optimize the model.
