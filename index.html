<!-- I have been interested in the scientific research and innovation since high school. After I entered the 
university, I joined the 718 Intelligent Car Laboratory, which is known as the 
cradle of scientific innovation in the school. Together with members of this 
Lab, I participated in the 2020 National University Students Intelligent Car 
Race and Electronics Design Contest sucessively. At the end of fresh year, 
I was promoted as the manager of 718 Intelligent Car Laboratory. As the 
person in charge, I organized the recruiting, training and competitions on campus. 
Through these activities, I developed skills in embedded software development 
and project management. 
<br><br>
At the beginning of my sophomore year, I joined the 
HERO Competitive Robot Team and worked in the electronic control group. 
In this group, I focused on the electronic control of the PTZ and self-aiming, 
and refactored the concerning code. During the winter vacation, I became the 
vice leader of HERO Competitive Robot Team and became a member in the vision/algorithm 
group, responsible for the visual preprocessing. Later, I became the leader of the 
HERO team in the 2022 season of `RoboMaster`, which is the most influential robot 
competition for college students in China. 
<br><br>
This is a new journey full of unknown 
challenges, and I will continue to stick to my passion and embrace rainstorms 
or rainbows ahead. -->
